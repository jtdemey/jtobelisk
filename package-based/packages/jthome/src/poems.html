              If I were to start anew,<br>
              I'd like to think I'd never do<br>
              The same mistakes that got me here<br>
              But honestly it's quite hard to<br>
              Deny the pen and signature.<br><br>

              Some days I wish I could depart<br>
              From this stale jail and I could start<br>
              A fresh new life by my own hand<br>
              But I have binds that clasp my heart,<br>
              Anchored and weighed down where I stand.<br><br>

              Time walks on indifferently<br>
              I beg and plead "Oh please, take me!"<br>
              But on he goes with steady pace.<br>
              I've played my cards all wrong, I see.<br>
              I guess I've lost this shitty race.<br>

              Scrape it away:<br>
              The coagulated conversations,<br>
              Rehearsed roles, disingenuous titters, and<br>
              Tapdances we know but don't want to do.<br>
              I can't see you, only your middlemen &mdash;<br>
              Little sculptures and characters and trite words<br>
              That sit between you and me.<br>
              Have we ever even spoken?<br>
              Usurped truths and unwatered seeds<br>
              Will starve above our rotting corpses.<br>

              Words don't fit right.<br>
              Stencil warps on cracked concrete.<br>
              Think about the weather<br>
              Like you normally do.<br><br>
              Two hawks on a tree top<br>
              And that same noxious air<br>
              That never changes.<br><br>
              Plastic on the lawn of my<br>
              Dead grandpa's workplace<br>
              That looks like a husk<br>
              Like he must have looked<br>
              Two days after his last drink.<br>
              Words don't get the point across.<br>

            <p class="text-content">
              I come from the woods, a town set in brown:<br>
              Scurrying life forms of leaves on the ground,<br>
              The lingering stench of swamp-water and weed,<br>
              And faint, distant laugh of wood-dweller unseen.<br><br>

              But these trees hold more than critters and plants.<br>
              Venture deeper in, and you might, by chance,<br>
              Find cities we've built, from refuse and waste:<br>
              Glorious empires through which kings once paced.<br><br>

              Not far to the West, upon the swamp's edge,<br>
              Our capitol stood: assembled garbage<br>
              Where nights once were spent in congregation<br>
              Formulating plans to forge our nation.<br><br>

              We once had neighbors adjacent to here.<br>
              They built quite a fort, but wouldn't come near.<br>
              They kept to themselves; likewise, so did we.<br>
              Then one day they left, before we could meet.<br><br>

              A tad to the East, a fallen tree sleeps,<br>
              The roots of which housed a table and seats<br>
              Where teammates would spend the eves of their days<br>
              Smoking and drinking their troubles away.<br><br>

              Further Southeast, through the thistles and mud,<br>
              Lies a lone haven: my own sweat and blood.<br>
              My waterfront stage; grand magnum opus.<br>
              I've spent so much time alone in Venice.<br><br>

              To the back of the woods, before the clear night,<br>
              Stands somber landscape, a sad sorry sight<br>
              Where fortress once laid, and hammocks once swayed,<br>
              Your memories stay &mdash; Rest in Peace, RK.<br><br>

              Our cities might not all stand to this day,<br>
              But follow my verse; don't get led astray.<br>
              You'll find the ruins, and maybe you'll see<br>
              That PG Woods lives, it speaks, and it breathes.<br>

              Rotten, bagworm-ridden,<br>
              Teeming with bugs and fungi,<br>
