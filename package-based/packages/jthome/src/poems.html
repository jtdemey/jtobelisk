        <h2 class="content-header">"Fluorescent"</h2>
        <p>
          If I were to start anew,
          I'd like to think I'd never do
          The same mistakes that got me here
          But honestly it's quite hard to
          Deny the pen and signature.

          Some days I wish I could depart
          From this stale jail and I could start
          A fresh new life by my own hand
          But I have binds that clasp my heart
          Anchored and weighed down where I stand.

          Time walks on indifferently
          I beg and plead "Oh please, take me!"
          But on he goes with steady pace
          I've played my cards all wrong, I see
          I guess I've lost this shitty race.
        </p>

        <h2 class="content-header">"Bagworms"</h2>
        <p>
          In my mind there's a forest
          With a big, dead tree
          Standing higher and larger than the rest.
          Rotten, bagworm-ridden,
          Teeming with bugs and fungi
          With branches reaching too far
          And roots reaching too deep.
        </p>

        <h2 class="content-header">"Neck craned at the intersection"</h2>
        <p>
          Scrape it away:
          The coagulated conversations,
          Rehearsed roles, disingenuous titters, and
          Tapdances we know but don't want to do.
          I can't see you, only your middlemen --
          Little sculptures and characters and trite words
          That sit between you and me.
          Have we ever even spoken?
          Usurped truths and unwatered seeds
          Will starve above our rotting corpses.
