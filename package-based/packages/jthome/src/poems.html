            <h2 class="content-header">"Fluorescent"</h2>
            <p>
              If I were to start anew,<br>
              I'd like to think I'd never do<br>
              The same mistakes that got me here<br>
              But honestly it's quite hard to<br>
              Deny the pen and signature.<br>

              Some days I wish I could depart<br>
              From this stale jail and I could start<br>
              A fresh new life by my own hand<br>
              But I have binds that clasp my heart<br>
              Anchored and weighed down where I stand.<br>

              Time walks on indifferently<br>
              I beg and plead "Oh please, take me!"<br>
              But on he goes with steady pace<br>
              I've played my cards all wrong, I see<br>
              I guess I've lost this shitty race.<br>
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-header">"Neck craned at the intersection"</h2>
            <p>
              Scrape it away:<br>
              The coagulated conversations,<br>
              Rehearsed roles, disingenuous titters, and<br>
              Tapdances we know but don't want to do.<br>
              I can't see you, only your middlemen --<br>
              Little sculptures and characters and trite words<br>
              That sit between you and me.<br>
              Have we ever even spoken?<br>
              Usurped truths and unwatered seeds<br>
              Will starve above our rotting corpses.<br>
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-header">"Realtor of the Month"</h2>
            <p>
              Words don't fit right.<br>
              Stencil warps on cracked concrete.<br>
              Think about the weather<br>
              Like you normally do.<br>
              Two hawks on a tree top<br>
              And that same noxious air<br>
              That never changes.<br>
              Plastic on the lawn of my<br>
              Dead grandpa's workplace<br>
              That looks like a husk<br>
              Like he must have looked<br>
              Two days after his last drink.<br>
              Words don't get the point across.<br>
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-header">"Bagworms"</h2>
            <p>
              Have you been to the forest<br>
              With a big, dead tree<br>
              Standing higher and larger than the rest --<br>
              Rotten, bagworm-ridden,<br>
              Teeming with bugs and fungi,<br>
              With branches reaching too far<br>
              And roots reaching too deep?<br>
            </p>
